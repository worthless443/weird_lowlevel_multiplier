# Multiply integers as you would do with vector multipication 
Aiming to use vector multipication instead of standard method of multipication between two natural whole integers and instead use vector of different dimentionss. 
# Core ideology
 * without needing any multipication instructions from the CPU
 * working only with bits to interpret base-10 integers as "components"(0)
# Working with bits to interpret 
## Work in progress
Only multipication with specific numbers (those which are possibly aligned) work and doesn't work for anything <100 and >1023
